    <strong>Dear Santa,<br><br>

        Merry Christmas in advance to you. <br><br>

        While 2024 has been a lot, showing me shege here and there, it still gives me great pleasure to write you this
        <br>
        letter as we get into the festive season. Lately, I’ve been reminiscing on how Christmas used to be. As a
        child,<br>
        I looked forward to the Christmas season with great joy and excitement. Growing up on the outskirts of Lagos, in
        <br>
        a predominantly bushy estate, the first sign of the festive season was the arrival of the hazy harmattan <br>
        weather, the type common in the North. Reliving those memories gives me nostalgia.<br><br>

        One of my favourite things during the holidays was firing bangers (fireworks). However, I had an unforgettable
        <br>
        experience one Christmas when I was about 11 or 12 years old. One of the bangers I threw towards a bushy area
        <br>
        caught fire and spread rapidly due to the harmattan winds. Luckily, it did not reach the houses nearby, and the
        <br>
        fire was quickly extinguished with buckets of water, with the help of my neighbours. After that incident, I <br>
        vowed never to throw bangers again. <br><br>

        Christmas Day always started on an interesting note, with carols playing on the DVD player in the living room.
        <br>
        However, it was never complete without my father’s high-spirited energy. I remember the morning excitement as he
        <br>
        prepared to slaughter the chickens we had home-grown all year long. I will later join my sister and mother in
        <br>
        the kitchen to prepare the chicken alongside our signature Christmas dish, Jollof Rice. After hours of
        cooking,<br>
        the evening ended with us eating together, gisting and watching movies.<br><br>

        Sadly, since my father died in 2009, Christmas has never been the same. I miss him. I miss the good, old days. I
        <br>
        remember how gloomy Christmas was the year he passed on. He died in mid-November and was buried the first week
        <br>
        of December. I had barely grieved properly when Christmas came knocking and the memories came rushing back.<br>
        Christmas made me finally accept that he was gone forever. <br><br>

        As a child, Christmas was my best time of the year. From the weather and food to being surrounded by family, the
        <br>
        memories remain etched in my heart forever. I won’t trade those times for anything in this world. My siblings
        <br>
        are across continents and now Christmas feels completely different, especially for a single pringle like me who
        <br>
        has no family of her own yet.<br><br>

        If I could ask for anything from you, Santa, it would be the perfect opportunity to relieve those memories <br>
        again. I dealt with a lot in 2024 that put my mental health at stake. Hence, I believe selecting me for this fun
        <br>
        and exciting day with Breather Renaissance will not only help me feel like a child again but also help me end
        <br>
        the year in good spirits.<br><br>

        Thank you, Santa, and I look forward to being surprised by you. Merry Christmas once again.<br><br>

        Yours sincerely,<br><br>

        Odubanjo Anu. <br><br>
